* Current Implementations

** Open Agent Architecture

   Doc/Distrib : http://www.ai.sri.com/~oaa/distrib.html
** Elvin
   http://elvin.org/papers/auug97/auug97.html
** NetP
** CALO:
   CALO has six higher functions ( which can be classified into modules?)
   
   - Organizing and Prioritizing Information
   - Preparing Information Artifacts
   - Mediating Human Communications
   - Task Management
   - Scheduling and Reasoning in Time
   - Resource allocation

*** Cons
    Focuses a lot on being a personal digital assistant. All its progress is based on how well the digital assitant does. This is reflected by the papers published by the organization and also the main objectives.
*** Reference: A cognitive framework for delegating to an assitive digital agent

** OpenAIR:
   I don't think openAIR is even relevant enough. Somebody from the company seems to have made the wikipage. Psyclone by CM Labs ,which features on the mind makers sounds more like what we are going for. Uses a blackboard system and openAIR protocol.
** CORBA:
   Lots of problems. All stated on the wikipage [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA

   Excerpt:
   Over the last few decades only a handful of methodologies have been proposed for
   building large, integrated AI systems â€“ Behavior-Oriented Design (BOD; [5]), the Sub-
   sumption Architecture [4], Belief, Desires, Intentions (BDI; cf. [28]), and the Construc-
   tionist Design Methodology (CDM) [37] are among them. CDM rests on solid present-day
   principles of software engineering, but is specifically designed to help developers man-
   age system expansion; its principles allow continuous architecture-preserving expansion of
   complex systems involving large numbers of executable modules, computers, developers,
   and research teams.

   Architectures like Psyclone, solutions addressing similar needs include Elvin [33], the Open Agent Architecture [18] and NetP [13].
